# Welcome to Design World ✨

Here’s a blog with **code** and images!

Smartphones are no longer a thing for communication only: today, they cover multiple needs and  help us to solve a variety of problems. Mobile applications let us study and entertain, do a lot of basic operations in seconds, calculate and  edit, remind and connect us to other people, and so on, and so forth.  According to the collection of useful stats about mobile marketing, in 2017 users spent on average 69% of their media time on smartphones,  and this number is constantly growing. In 2018, there are reported about 8 million apps in the Google Play store, 2.2 million in the Apple App  Store, 669K in the Windows Store, and 600K in the Amazon Appstore. Not  only the number grows but also diversity, and that’s clearly seen from  the variety of design projects. So, today we offer to review the most  popular types of mobile applications, their functions, and benefits – in addition to the guide into types of websites and types of mobile screens we told about earlier. With lots of examples by Tubik designers, of course.
There are two global perspectives to classify mobile apps: in the  aspect of content they offer and the aspect of their technical  realization. Let’s start with the content.
Content Perspective
Here we classify the applications according to the problems they solve and the functions they offer to users.
Utility Apps
This is the basic and perhaps the most widely used type of mobile  applications. These apps let users solve a particular problem or  accomplish a task, usually the one we face day in and day out. It’s all  about basic problems which should be solved quickly – and this is what  apps of this type do, saving our time and effort. Here you will find a  variety of calculators from standard to financial and scientific ones,  clock and alarm apps, flashlights, barcode scanners, tools for  conversion and password management, screen locks, etc. They are little  helpers of our everyday life.
